## About me:

I have more than nine years of experience as a professional graphic designer in the advertising field. I also have been meeting with clients to determine the scope of a project, to refine the message the design should communicate and help develop strategies to reach the target market.

I’m a person who strives to thrive in a fast-paced environment, so, right now I’m looking for an opportunity to apply my technical experience and my creative problem-solving skills as a Front-end Developer.
